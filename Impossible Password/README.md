# Program TLDR
Program checks user input against 2 password with the second password being virtually impossible to know unless the binary is modified. The flag is stored in the binary in plaintext and is xor'd with 0x9 to create the final flag which is printed to the terminal if both password checks are passed.

# Function Overview:
- [main()](./func_main.pdf): Gets both user inputs, checks against passwords, and calls gen_rand_pass() and xor_flag()
- [gen_rand_pass()](./func_gen_rand_pass.pdf): Generates a random password for the second password check. The random password is 24 characters long and each character is generated by `(rand() / 0x5E) + 0x21`. This function is called after the user gives their input so it is virtually impossible to guess under normal execution.
- [xor_flag()](./func_xor_flag.pdf): The plaintext flag `A]Kr=9k0=0o0;k1?k81t` located in main is passed as in input to this function. This function xor's each character with 0x9 to generate the final flag `HTB{40b949f92b86b18}`. The end result is printed to the termianl
